# Goal

Create a proramm for drawing rotation of 3d cube without 3d libs. 

I will use opencv for drawing now.

# How it works

At first we define coorninates of cubes angles. 

Then we apply tansformation to them. In this case it is matrix rotation.

The project 3d coordinates to virtual plane using intrinsic camera matrix

Draw points in the coordinates
